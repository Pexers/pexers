### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜‰
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Pedro Rodrigues, from Lisbon, Portugal, and I'm currently finishing my MSc degree in Computer Science.

I fell into the world of Computer Science starting from a young age, and I've never looked back since then. I'm truly passionate about building efficient, secure and maintainable software systems.

I enjoy helping out other developers whenever I can, so feel free to reach out! 

**Languages of choice:** `Java`, `Kotlin`, `JavaScript`, `C#`, `C`
