### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜‰
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Pedro Rodrigues from Lisbon, Portugal, and I'm currently finishing my MSc degree in Computer Science.

I fell into Computer Science when I was little, and never looked back since. I'm truly passionate about building efficient, secure and maintainable software systems.

Feel free to reach out! I enjoy helping out other developers whenever I can.
